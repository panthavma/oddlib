# OddLib

This is the partial public release of OddLib, which I use for my projects as Odd Gear Games.
I will make a better documentation and fuller release when I have more time.

This should be considered an early release with a lot of the functionality lacking. I will update it after the next Kronian Titans demo releases.

## Installation

Move the oddlib-shaders folder into your project.

## Examples

No examples yet, but a code sample for the pipelines can be found in this article :
